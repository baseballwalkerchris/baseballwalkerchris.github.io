# Here's a little more about me!

I'm a passionate, curious software engineer that specializes in backend development. I love building new, large-scale projects that leverage cutting-edge tools/technologies to create accessible and effective solutions. 

I began my studies at Cornell as a Chemical Engineering major, but I switched to Computer Science after my first CS course (Intro to Python), as I really liked the problem-solving, logical nature of the assignments. 

I consider myself as someone who is always seeking to improve my programming skills and knowledge through reading documentation, building new projects, and collaborating with others. 

Outside of the classroom, I am often running outside, enjoying Ithacaâ€™s beautiful nature. I also enjoy playing basketball and rock climbing!

Please feel free to reach out!
